# Why React Over JS?
React is a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, specifically focusing on the "view" layer of applications. While JavaScript offers flexibility, React introduces enhancements that simplify and optimize the development process, especially in large applications.

## DOM Manipulation: 
Virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the actual DOM.  
- Reach compares the Virtual DOM with actual DOM.
- It then updates only the changed compnenets, reducing the number of DOM manipulations.
- This process leads to better performance and faster rendering, especially in large-scale applications.

## Unidirectional Data Flow:
Managing state and data flow in traditional JavaScript can be tricky, especially when dealing with bidirectional data binding. This often leads to unexpected side effects and makes it harder to trace the flow of data through the application. React adopts a unidirectional data flow, meaning data only flows in one direction, from parent to child components.
- Makes state management predictable and simpler to debug.
- React's state management is echanced with libraries like Flix or Redux for centralized state management, further improving maintainability.

## Componentization:
React promites a component-based architecture, which makes it easy to create self-contained, reusable components.
- Components are modular, meaning you can write them once and reuse them throughout the application.
- Each component encapsulates specific functionality, improving the maintainability and scalability of your codebase.
- This modular approach improves collaboration, as teams can work on isolated components without interfering with other parts of the code.

## React is Declarative while Vanilla JS is Imperative
In imperative programming, developers explicitly write step-by-step instuctions for the computer to follow. This involves detailing exactly how a task should be accomplished, often involving direct manipulation of the DOM.  
React takes a declarative approach. Instead of specifying how tasks should be performed, developers declare what the UI should look like based on the current state of the application. React abstracts away the direct manipulation of the DOM by introducing a virtual representation of it.
> Declarative nature makes it easier to understand, maintain, and scale applications.
