# useRef Hook
It creates a mutable reference object. It does not trigger re-render, but it persists across renders, providing a means to retain values or interact with DOM elements.

## Advanced Applications
1. **Imperative DOM Manipulation**: Facilitates direct interaction with DOM elements.

2. **Preserving Values**: useRef can store mutable values that persist across renders without triggering re-renders. This makes it suitable for maintaining state-like data without affecting component rendering.
