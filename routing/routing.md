# Introduction Routing
Creating single-page applications (SPAs) has become a standard practice due to their enhanced user experience and performance. One essential aspect of SPAs is navigation, and React provides a robust solution through its routing capabilities.

## React Routing
React routing allows developers to manage navigation and rendering of components in a web application. React provides a seamless transition between different views within a single HTML page.

## Getting started with React Router
React Router comrises several key components, each playing a distinct role in facilitating navigation and view management:
1. **BrowserRouter:** Leveraging HTML5 history API to syynchronie the application's UI with the URL. By intercepting UEL changes, BrowserRouter enables seamless navigation without triggering full-page reloads.
2. **Route:** Define mapping between specific URL apths and the corresponding components. By associating components with specific URLs, developers create a hierarchical structure that mirrors the application's navigation flow.
3. **Switch:** Ensures that only one route is rendered at a time, preventing multiple components from being displayed simultaneously.
4. **Link:** By leveraging Link components instead of traditional anchor tags, developers can ensure that navigation occurs within the confines of the React Router environment, preserving the SPA paradigm.
