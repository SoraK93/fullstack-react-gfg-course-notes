# useState Hook
Managing state is a fundamental aspect of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Traditionally, class components were used to handle state management in React applications.

useState is a React Hook that allows developers to add stteful logic directly within functional components.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

/*
Here state represents the current state value,a nd setState is a function used to update the state. The initialState parameter sets the initial value of the state variable.
*/
```

## Benefits of useState
1. **SimplifiedSyntax**: Concise and declarative syntax for managing state within functional components.
2. **Improved Readability**: Encapsulating state logic directly within function enhances code readability and maintainability.
3. **Lightweight and Efficient**: Ensure optimal performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders of components.
